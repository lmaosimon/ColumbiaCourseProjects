    "For instance, the construction of a commercial airliner involves millions of mechanical parts. Each part of the aircraft will have a degree of error in length, weight, or performance due to simple variation in quality control — all pieces meeting a minimum standard, but not perfect. Even though all parts individually may work without perceivable error, in a complex machine like an aircraft, the accumulated error may be catastrophic. Traditionally, technicians must manually conduct multiple systemic evaluations of the plane, which cost tremendous amounts of time and money. Using an unsupervised approach, such as Anomaly Detection, and data regarding the quality of each part, an algorithm can holistically assess the amount of accumulated error and determine to what extent the accumulated errors affect the quality of the plane’s airworthiness, before the plane even leaves the warehouse.\n",
