## Task 1

Demonstrate some arithmetic in R using `+,-,*,/,(), and ^`.


```{r task1}
# Demonstrate +
1 + 2
# Demonstrate -
1 - 2
# Demonstrate *
1 * 2
# Demonstrate /
1 / 2
# Demonstrate ()
(1+2) * 3
# Demonstrate ^
2 ^ 3
```

## Task 2

Going beyond the **division operator**.

a) What does the **%%** operator do? See if you can figure it out via trial and error by running it with a bunch of numbers. 
For example,`5 %% 2`. Then confirm your guess by looking it up online and/or with help, as in help(**’%%’**).
