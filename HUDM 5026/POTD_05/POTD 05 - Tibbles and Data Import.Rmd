```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r task0}
# Import libraries.
library(tidyverse)
```

## Task 1

Update the code for reading in your data as a tibble based on techniques covered in WG, ch. 11.
```{r task 1}
# using state.x77 data and import them to tibble.
dat <- read_csv('PTSD_Outcomes_Within_Each_Treatment_Arm.csv')
dat <- tibble(dat)
dat
```
That's good, no probelms with the data.


## Task 2

Continue working with your data to create two new plots, at least one of which is multivariate.
```{r task 2}
names(dat)[names(dat) == 'Treatment Focus (Arm level)'] <- 'Treatment'
p1 <- dat %>%
  filter('Total N Randomized' > 100)
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x=Treatment, y = "Year Added to PTSD_Repository")) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r task 3}
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x='Intervention Group', y = 'Total N Randomized')) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
