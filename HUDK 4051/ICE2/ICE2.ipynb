    "NLP is a branch of data science that consists of systematic processes for analyzing, understanding, and deriving information from the text data in a smart and efficient manner. By utilizing NLP and its components, one can organize the massive chunks of text data, perform numerous automated tasks and solve a wide range of problems such as – automatic summarization, machine translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation etc. Obviously, we won't be able to cover everything in one ICE. This ICE intent to introduce you to some basics of NLP techniques."

    "## Organizing Data\n",
    "Now, the data is almost ready to be analyzed. But before that, there are two important concepts for text formats you need to know: <br>\n",
    ">1. Corpus: a collection of text\n",
    ">2. Document-Term Matrix: word counts in matrix format\n",
    "\n",
    "What we already have is a corpus. It is human-readable because it stores the data in a natural language style. However, For many of the techniques we'll be using, algorithms do not recognize our natural language. Particularly, the statistics tools we have been using/learning relies on processing quantifiable numbers.<br><br>\n",
    "As a result, we need to tokenize the text/corpus, meaning broken the text down into smaller pieces. The most common tokenization technique is to break down text into words. Essentially, we are taking a dictionary of words and mark the occurence frequency and/or the order of each word for each text in the corpus. Then we can represent a corpus in the quantitative (but not quite human-readable) way. And it is called Document-Term Matrix, where every row will represent a different document and every column will represent a different word.<br><br>\n",
    "You can imagine that once the documents get longer and complicated, we may be dealing with a very wide and sparse matrix, which is not ideal for any statistics modeling. Therefore, we have two more important concepts to help simplify the process<br>\n",
    ">1. Bag-of-words: We treat each document as a big bag of words. We don't necessarily care the orders of the words (i.e., grammar) at this stage. Just knowing the semantic meaning of each words can already tell us a lot. In fact, aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are.\n",
    ">2.Stop words: They are a set of commonly used words in a language. Examples of stop words in English are “a”, “the”, “is”, “are” and etc. Stop words are so commonly used that they carry very little useful information. So getting rid of them might be a good idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the task can sound complicated, We can automate this using scikit-learn's CountVectorizer() to build a document-term matrix in a BOW style without the common stop words fairly easily. <br><br>\n",
    "In cv= CountVectorizer(), CountVectorizer() randomly assigns a number to each word in a process called tokenizing. Then, it counts the number of occurrences of words and saves it to cv. At this point, we’ve only assigned a method to cv."
